          Q-1. What is difference among map, filter, forEach and find method??
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          forEach method is used to execute the same code on every element in an
          array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. <br />
          map method is used to executes the same code on every element in an
          array and returns a new array with the updated elements. <br />
          filter method checks every element in an array to see if it meets a
          certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return
          truthy for the criteria. <br />
          find returns the value of the first element that passes a test and
          returns undefined if no elements are found.

          Q-2. What is difference among Local storage,Session storage and
          Cookies??
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Session storage stores a larger amount of data on the client's
          computer only for the current session, expiring the data on tab close.
          Data is never transferred to the server and is accessible client-side
          from the same tab. <br />
          Local storage stores a larger amount of data on the client's computer
          in a key-value pair format and has no expiration date. Data is never
          transferred to the server. <br />
          Cookies store small amounts of data that has to be sent back to the
          server with subsequent requests and their expiration can be set from
          either server or client.

        <p>Q-3. What is Event loop? and how it works??</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Event loop is what allows javascript to handle thousands and thousands
          of requests with just a single thread. It monitor the Call Stack and
          the Callback Queue. Event loop is a process that waits for the Call
          Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the
          Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and
          checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it
          pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear
          again, and repeats the same process.
